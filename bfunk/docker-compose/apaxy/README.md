# Apaxy

apaxy is a customisable theme built to enhance the experience of browsing web directories. It uses the `mod_autoindex` Apache module - and some css - to override the default style of a directory listing.

## Features

Apaxy may be basic, but it gives you a great deal of creative freedom when styling your directory.

* style your directory listing with css
* make it pop with javascript
* add welcome messages, download instructions or copyright notices
* add custom media type icons (requires editing the `.htaccess` file)
* use custom error pages

*Sadly, visual style is all you can work with. It's not possible to alter the generated table structure of the listing directory with Apaxy.*

## Installation

apaxy requires an apache (2.2.11+) enabled http server.

### Quick start

If you would like, you can automate the installation of Apaxy with the included `apaxy-configure.sh` script.

To get started, first open `apaxy.config` in your favorite editor, then edit the `apacheWebRootPath` and `installWebPath` variables to correspond to your server's settings. Save the file and exit.

You can set some parameters of `apaxy.config` on the command line instead of the config file. You can see the documentation of the cli with the following command: `apaxy-configure.sh -h`.

Then run the configuration script as a user that can write to the `installWebPath` directory. With apache under debian, this would be the `www-data` user:

	$ sudo -u www-data ./apaxy-configure.sh

The files will be copied to the web server directory, and modified automatically based on the settings specified.

### Manual install

Let's assume you have a folder named `share` in your server root directory (the path thus being `http://mywebsite.com/share`) that you'd like to use as your listing directory:

- [download](https://github.com/oupala/apaxy/archive/master.zip) and unzip apaxy
- copy and paste the contents of the `/apaxy` folder to your `/share` folder
- edit `htaccess.txt` (now in the `/share` folder) and update all instances of paths marked with *{FOLDERNAME}* to point to your site root

So...

```apache
AddIconByType (gif,{FOLDERNAME}/theme/icons/gif.png) image/gif
```

Should be changed to...

```apache
AddIconByType (gif,/share/theme/icons/gif.png) image/gif
```

- if you want to enable the [gallery](#gallery) feature, overwrite the header and footer files:

```bash
mv footer-lightgallery.html footer.html
mv header-lightgallery.html header.html
```

- edit `footer.html`, along with all the other `html` documents (in the `/share/theme` folder) and update all instances of paths marked with *{FOLDERNAME}* to point to your site root

So...

```html
<script src={FOLDERNAME}/theme/apaxy.js></script>
```

Should be changed to...

```html
<script src=/share/theme/apaxy.js></script>
```

* once done, rename `htaccess.txt` to `.htaccess` in the `/share` directory
* [treat yo'self](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lw7q28y0Mz1qanm80o1_500.gif), you're done!

## Docker image

A [local Demo](http://localhost:8080) can be started with docker.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Apaxy themes

If you'd like to alter the default Apaxy theme, look in the `/theme` folder and you'll find the following files:

- `header.html`
- `footer.html`
- `style.css`

Edit these as you would any other html or css file.

Adding your own icons is a little more involved. You'll need to edit the main Apaxy `.htaccess` file. Look for the following as an example:

```apache
AddIconByType (gif,{FOLDERNAME}/theme/icons/gif.png) image/gif
```

The above rule will assign an icon named `gif.png` from the directory `{FOLDERNAME}/theme/icons/` to any file whose media type is `image/gif`.

This url path is relative to your site's root.

## Media types

The default apaxy theme `/themes/apaxy` has icons in place for the following media types:

## Gallery

You can enable a gallery feature on apaxy. This feature is based on [lightgallery.js](https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightgallery.js/).

See [installation](#installation) section for more information.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure the options set in `.htaccess` files of Apaxy can actually be changed. This means that you need to allow to override the used options in your apache configuration of the directory apaxy used with: `AllowOverride Indexes`.

Find more information in the in the [apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride).

## Credits

apaxy owes its existence to the amazing [h5ai](http://larsjung.de/h5ai/) by [Lars Jung](https://twitter.com/lrsjng). Had I not seen this, I would never have looked into making my own (probably way less useful) version.

[Faenza Icons](http://tiheum.deviantart.com/art/Faenza-Icons-173323228) are used in the `apaxy` theme.
