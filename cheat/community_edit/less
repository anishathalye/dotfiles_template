# To disable the terminal refresh when exiting:
less -X

# To save the contents to a file:
# Method 1 - Only works when the input is a pipe
s <filename>

# Method 2 - This should work whether input is a pipe or an ordinary file:
Type g or < (g or less-than) | $ (pipe then dollar) then cat > <filename> and Enter.
