You can do it in screen the terminal multiplexer.

    To split vertically: ctrla then |.
    To split horizontally: ctrla then S (uppercase one).
    To unsplit: ctrla then Q (uppercase one).
    To switch from one to the other: ctrla then tab

Note: After splitting, you need to go into the new region and start a new session via ctrla then c before you can use that area.

EDIT, basic screen usage:

    New terminal: ctrla then c.
    Next terminal: ctrla then space.
    Previous terminal: ctrla then backspace.
    N'th terminal ctrla then [n]. (works for n∈{0,1…9})
    Switch between terminals using list: ctrla then " (useful when more than 10 terminals)
    Send ctrla to the underlying terminal ctrla then a.
