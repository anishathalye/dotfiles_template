# To ssh via pem file (which normally needs 0600 permissions):
ssh -i <pemfile> <user>@<host>

# To connect on a non-standard port:
ssh -p <port> <user>@<host>

# To connect and forward the authentication agent:
ssh -A <user>@<host>

# To execute a command on a remote server:
ssh -t <user>@<host> 'the-remote-command'

# To tunnel an x session over SSH:
ssh -X <user>@<host>

# Redirect traffic with a tunnel between local host (port 8080) and a remote
# host (remote.example.com:5000) through a proxy (personal.server.com):
ssh -f -L 8080:remote.example.com:5000 user@personal.server.com -N

# To launch a specific x application over SSH:
ssh -X -t <user>@<host> 'chromium-browser'

# To create a SOCKS proxy on localhost and <port>:
ssh -qND <port> <user>@<host>

# To tunnel an ssh session over the SOCKS proxy on localhost and port 9999:
ssh -o "ProxyCommand nc -x 127.0.0.1:9999 -X 4 %h %p" <user>@<host>

# -X use an xsession, -C compress data, "-c blowfish" use the encryption blowfish:
ssh <user>@<host> -C -c blowfish -X

# For more information, see:
# http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/12755/44856

# To copy files and folders through ssh from remote host to pwd with tar.gz
# compression when there is no rsync command available:
ssh <user>@<host> "cd /var/www/Shared/; tar zcf - asset1 asset2" | tar zxf -

# To mount folder/filesystem through SSH
# Install SSHFS from https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs
# Will allow you to mount a folder securely over a network.
sshfs <user>@<host>:/path/to/folder /path/to/mount/point

# Emacs can read file through SSH
# Doc: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Remote-Files.html

# rt forwarding

# port forwarding on my machine via its6 :
ssh -fNg -L 5556:DEST-MACHINE:5432 VIA-TUNNEL-MACHINE6 ssh -A USERd@DEST-MACHINE

# port forwarding to scp via ssh tunnel :
# Step 1: Establish SSH tunnel. Pick a temporary port between 1024 and 32768 (12345 in this example). Port 22 will be used by scp.
ssh -fNg -L 12345:DEST-machine:22 TUNNEL-MACHINE
# Step 2: Run scp against port 1234 pretending 127.0.0.1 (localhost) is the remote machine R, and the command will be sent to R.
scp -r  -P 12345 USER@127.0.0.1:/mnt/opendap/1/IMOS/opendap/Argo/dac/csiro/5903665 dest-dir-local
